//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let arr = ['matrix', 'matrix reloaded', 'matrix revolutions'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let movie1 = arr[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let arrLength = arr.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?


let lastElement = arr[arrLength - 1]
 console.log(lastElement);
